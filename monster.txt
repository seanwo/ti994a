The monster at the end of this book
By john stone.
Illustrated by michael smollin.

What did that say?
On the first page, what did that say?
Did that say there will be a monster at the end of this book?
It did?
Oh, I am so scared of monsters!

Shhhh.
Listen, I have an idea.
If you do not turn any pages, we will never get to the end of this book.
And that is good because there is a monster at the end of this book.
So please do not turn the page.

You turned the page!

Maybe you do not understand.
You see, turning pages will bring us to the end of this book, and there is a monster at the end of this book.
But this will stop you from turning pages.
See?
I am tying the pages together so you cannot.

You turned another page!
You do not know what you are doing to me.
Now, stop turning pages!

There!
I, grover, am nailing this page to the next one so that you will not be able to turn it, and we will not get any closer to the monster at the end of this book.

All right!
All right!
All right!
Do you know that every time you turn another page, you not only get us closer to the monster at the end of this book, but you make a terrible mess!

This will stop you from turning pages.
A heavy, thick, solid, strong brick wall.
I would just like to see you try to turn this page.

Do you know that you are very strong?

The next page is the end of this book, and there is a monster at the end of this book.
Oh, I am so scared!
Please do not turn the page.
Please!
Please!
Please!

Well, look at that!
This is the end of the book and the only one here is, me.
I, lovable, furry old grover, am the monster at the end of this book.
Any you were so scared!
I told you and told you there was nothing to be afraid of.
The end.

Oh, I am so embarrassed.
